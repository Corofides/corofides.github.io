# PlayJam 4

https://itch.io/jam/playjam-4

As mentioned yesterday I'm going to be taking part in the PlayJam 4 and try and create a game for the Playdate in Lua. 
I'm going to be posting updates to this page as I progress so I'm setting it up in advance.

Not long to go. I'm probably not going to do much tonight as it's rather late for me these days but I do want to at least
see what the theme is and maybe start coding something. We'll see. I've held off on creating a repo. I've been playing
around in Lua and the SDK and am now feeling massively under prepared...

In the true spirit of these things I am totally confused as the theme seems not to be were I expected it to be. The 
repository is up though... guess I'll just start playing around with some angles until I can work out what the theme 
actually is.

Oh... it's Your Time Is Up.. I'm dumb. Actually that's kind of perfect.

Okay, so that started out terribly if I'm going to be honest. Not sure what was happening but my brain just was not 
playing ball. Anyway, managed to get sorted and I've got an isometric cube created that I can reuse. I added an Isometric
Square class as well and created a grid. I'm going to call it a night at this point and pick it up tomorrow.
