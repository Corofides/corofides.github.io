# Playdate SDK and Lua.

So taking a bit of a break from the Javascript I spent this afternoon and some of my lunchbreak playing around with the
Playdate SDK and Lua. Both of which I have zero experience in so that was kind of fun. I set up a [little repo](https://github.com/Corofides/PlaydateSkeleton)
to quickly get a skeleton project going for the SDK. Unfortunately it's not exactly platform agnostic. I was trying to 
find a way of setting up a new Project template in Intellij but I don't think it's doable without creating a plugin. I 
did generate a template for one but it wasn't the plan for today so I left it.

# Playdate

So yeah, I discovered this neat [console thing](https://play.date/) last night while trying to find a jam or hackathon
I could potentially enter. It seemed pretty neat and there's one this weekend so I ended up following a 
[YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-pbLrY3ro&t=656s) on it. It was pretty easy to follow along to. Mainly
it gives me a point of reference on [GitHub](https://github.com/Corofides/PlaydateYTTutorialGame) which is kind of useful
when you don't actually know what you are doing

## Thoughts on the Jam

I honestly have no idea how this will go. I don't tend to be very good at programming on the weekends so there's every 
chance it will get to Saturday and I'll just skip it. If I do however. I'm thinking isometric tower defence. I know you
are supposed to build to the theme but it's been a while since I did a jam and it seems like a fun idea. I've been wanting
to play around with isometric for a while so it sounds like a fun time.
