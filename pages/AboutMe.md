# Welcome to my site.

I'm Corofides, a programmer based in the North East of England. I've been working in programming for over a decade and
it's getting close to 20 years since I started to take my first steps into the world of all things code. If you know what
the BYOND Game Engine is.. well, that was pretty much the teenage years of my life. (If you made Castle. Massive fan.)

Other than programming I tend to go through hobbies ever so often and these are some of the things I'm interested in:

- Games
- Running
- Guitar
- Politics (don't @ me)
- Fantasy and Sci-fi

I'm starting this as a way of getting back into programming for fun. It's one of those things, you kind of start making
money from your hobby and suddenly you don't enjoy it as much. Anything I make should be on GitHub going forward. So
feel free to checkout my GitHub profile. (Admittedly at time of writing it's a bit of a graveyard but I'm working on it.)
