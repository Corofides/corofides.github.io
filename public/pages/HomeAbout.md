# Welcome to Shimmer

Shimmer is a site generator build to easily work with GitHub Pages for personal websites or project websites. It's
written in ReactJS using a blend of JSON and Markdown files to offer easy customisation. It supports posts and pages using
a widget based system to display a range of content on the frontend. I set this up to support my personal sites and projects
as an easy and quick why to create a range of interesting frontend sites to better support me as a developer and show off
my projects.
