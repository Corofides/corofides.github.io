# Something In, Something Out

Okay, so I have no idea why I am writing this or if it will continue but whatever.

I was kind of bored so I'd went to lay down in bed just sort of laying in the dark thinking about things. Like usual I
ended up thinking about stuff I could potentially do to make some money and that led me to think about games. Now, I'm
not really great at making stuff or following through on things and I've been watching a Pokemon Let's Play so I was
going down that kind of angle. RPG, Open Map, Menu combat system. Then I started thinking what if you simplify it even
more as a thought exercise. This led me to like Event based systems and the 'what is a game'? Question which leads to the
A happens -> B follows. Input -> Output, Something In -> Something Out.

Anyway, brain goes fucking nuts now thinking about event driven stuff and I thought it might be a fun little exercise
so... let's see what happens.

## Main Game Loop

So I've played around with the Playdate SDK and Lua a small amount and since I have a skeleton repo for a Lua project 
I thought it might be a fun place to start. So main.lua

```
import "CoreLibs/object"
import "CoreLibs/graphics"
import "CoreLibs/sprites"
import "CoreLibs/timer"

local pd <const> = playdate;

function playdate.update()
   --- Main Game Loop
end

```

This is the super basics of any game. At the beginning it's just a loop. Anything inside the loop is executed, the loop
repeats indefinitely until the game terminates. From the humble start menu, to the AAA games of today it all just starts
with a loop.

(Honestly, one of the worse things about modern dev is you get the idea to do something. Then start the repo, start the
IDE, wait ten minutes, consider how nice bed was...)

So, in this loop normally we might listen for some input. If I recall correctly the PlayDate has 7 buttons (not including
the crank) up, down, left, right, a, and b. These are our inputs. The premise would be we use one of these buttons and
we expect something to happen in response.

Let's just quickly do something like this:

```
function playdate.update()
   --- Main Game Loop

   if (pd.buttonIsPressed(pd.kButtonDown)) then
      print("Down Is Pressed")
   end

end
```

This is fairly straightforward: in the loop we check to see if the down button is pressed if it is we print the line
'Down Is Pressed' to the console. This works fine. We could model this for further buttons like so:

```
function playdate.update()
   --- Main Game Loop

   if (pd.buttonIsPressed(pd.kButtonDown)) then
      print("Down Is Pressed")
   end

   if (pd.buttonIsPressed(pd.kButtonUp)) then
      print("Up is pressed")
   end

end
```

Eventually we'd end up with a main loop that comprised all the buttons and the various behaviours that might act upon
them. Of course we'd need all the actions that could potentially occur within this represented somehow. Obviously if you
had everything just sitting in this one loop it would become rather cumbersome to deal with and this leads to various
abstractions and programming paradigms that allow us to deal with this more effectively.

This brings me to the why I had to start a repo and start writing. I kind of want to just play around with this. Using 
an event driven paradigm.

So let's start by adding all the potential inputs into our game loop.

```
function playdate.update()
   --- Main Game Loop

   if (pd.buttonIsPressed(pd.kButtonDown)) then
      print("Down Is Pressed")
   else
   end

   if (pd.buttonIsPressed(pd.kButtonUp)) then
      print("Up is pressed")
   else
   end

   if (pd.buttonIsPressed(pd.kButtonLeft)) then
      print("Left is pressed")
   else
   end

   if (pd.buttonIsPressed(pd.kButtonRight)) then
      print("Right is pressed")
   else
   end

   if (pd.buttonIsPressed(pd.kButtonA)) then
      print("A Button is Pressed")
   else
   end

   if (pd.buttonIsPressed(pd.kButtonB)) then
      print("B Button is Pressed")
   else
   end

end
```

We now have all the buttons and their states modelled for our input. This is the foundation and were we get to the event
driven part of it. For this we need an event. Let's create it as an object.

```
class("Event").extends();

function Event:init(name)
    self.name = name;
end
```

This isn't super sophisticated as for now we are just getting started. Okay, next we want to create an event emitter. The
idea will be that this will create events for us and then inform any listeners that are attached that the event has been
passed.

```lua
class("EventEmitter").extends()

function EventEmitter:init()
    self.listeners = {}
end

function EventEmitter:emitEvent(eventName)
    local event <const> = Event(eventName)

    for i, listener in pairs(self.listeners) do
        listener:onEvent(event)
    end
end

function EventEmitter:addListener(listener)
    table.insert(self.listeners, listener)
end
```

After this we need to create our listener. This will be a simple object (not sure if interfaces are a thing?) that can 
be extended upon. The idea is that these objects will listen for events that are passed to it and execute an action
upon that request. Let's create one.

```lua
class("Listener").extends()

function Listener:init() end

function Listener:onEvent(event)
    print("Event", event.name)
end
```

We now have everything we need so let's put it altogether with a simple example that just involves the up button.

```lua 
local pd <const> = playdate;
local inputEmitter = EventEmitter();
inputEmitter:addListener(Listener())

function playdate.update()
    --- Main Game Loop
    if (pd.buttonIsPressed(pd.kButtonUp)) then
        inputEmitter:emitEvent("kButtonUpIn")
    else
        inputEmitter:emitEvent("kButtonUpOut")
    end
end

```

This now puts us in a similar position to what we initially had in our game loop. When the up button is pressed we can
print out a line telling us this is the case and when it is not pressed a line is printed out telling us. This will 
execute every time the game loops.

## Input Controller.

Let's try and make this a bit more useful as currently this is just the same as what we had before but more abstracted. 
So at the moment we can only tell if the buttons are pressed or raised, we can add some more states to this fairly
easily. So let's start creating an Input Controller

```lua
class('InputController').extends('Listener')

function InputController:init(name, inputButtonName, eventEmitter)

    self.eventEmitter = eventEmitter
    self.isPressed = false
    self.name = name
    self.inputButtonName = inputButtonName

end

function InputController:onButtonDown()
    if (self.isPressed) then
        return;
    end

    self.isPressed = true
    self.eventEmitter:emitEvent(self.name .. "Press")
end

function InputController:onButtonUp()
    if (not self.isPressed) then
        return;
    end

    self.isPressed = false
    self.eventEmitter:emitEvent(self.name .. "Release")
    self.eventEmitter:emitEvent(self.name .. "Click")
end

function InputController:addListener(listener)
    self.eventEmitter:addListener(listener)
end

function InputController:onEvent(event)
    if (event.name == (self.inputButtonName .. "In")) then
        self:onButtonDown()
    end

    if (event.name == (self.inputButtonName .. "Out")) then
        self:onButtonUp();
    end
end
```

Okay, so what have we done here. We've created a controller class which extends the listener class, currently the listener
class is just for show more than anything. This takes a couple of different parameters a name, what this input is called,
an inputButtonName, this is which input button it should be listening for, and a event emitter.

The controller overrides the onEvent function of our listener class and checks to see if any of the events it cares about
have been fired, if not it does nothing, if it has it runs one of two functions

onButtonDown fires if the input if pressed, the controller has a property called isPressed, checking this property it will
either disregard the result if it is already pressed or, it will set the property to true and fire an event the name
concatenated with the "Press". I'm currently using a so this will be aPress.

The second function does a similar thing but the other way around. However this will also fire an event called "aClick".
We have now transformed our original events from just isUp, isDown to something more useful. We could even extend this 
later for more stuff. Like longClick or rapidClicks. Which is kind of neat.

To utilise this we just need to modify the main game loop a bit

```lua
local aInputController = InputController("a", "kButtonA", controllerEmitter)
aInputController.eventEmitter:addListener(inputListener)
inputEmitter:addListener(aInputController)
```

We now have a controller for the kButtonA input called a that will trigger our functionality.

## Creating a button.

Lets start to create something that can now take our inputs from the InputController. For brevity
and ease let's create a button. In games UI elements often get left til last so I thought it might be
fun to let them come first for once.

(Normally I've been writing these as I code but I'm doing it after so the thought process may not be as
well explained here.)

Let's begin by defining our Button class and init methods

```lua
class("Button").extends(gfx.sprite)

function Button:init(x, y, width, height, text, emitter)

    self._emitter = emitter

    self._focus = false;
    self._active = false;

    self.width = width;
    self.height = height;

    self._textWidth = 0
    self._textHeight = 0

    self._text = text;

    self._buttonPositionX = x;
    self._buttonPositionY = y - (height / 2);

    self.x = x;
    self.y = y;

    local font = gfx.getFont();
    self._textHeight = font:getHeight();
    self._textWidth = font:getTextWidth(text);

    self:displayButton()

end
```

The button will take an x, y coordinate which will be where it is positioned on the screen, width and height will define
how tall and wide our button is, the text element will be the text that should be shown in the button and the emitter is
the event emitter the button will broadcast on.

In the init function we can start setting up the properties for our button and a couple of methods I'll get to later. I 
skip some of the obvious properties were it's just taking what was passed and setting it as a property value.

We define _focus and _active. The focus property is how we tell if our button is the one that currently has context, i.e,
if it was a link in a webbrowser it would be the one that if you hit enter on the keyboard would be followed.

_active is used to see if we are currently pressing on the button.
_textWidth and _textHeight allow are used so we know the height and width of the text we are displaying the purpose of this
is to allow is to easily centre the text. We could do other things as well if we wanted like positioning it to the left or
right, top or bottom of the button.

_buttonPositionX, and Y are similar but for the button itself. Next we have the displayButton method

```lua
function Button:displayButton()

    local buttonImage = gfx.image.new(self.width, self.height)
    local textPositionX, textPositionY = self:calculateTextPosition()

    gfx.pushContext(buttonImage)
    if (self._focus) then
        gfx.drawRect(0, 0, self.width, self.height)

        if (self._active) then
            gfx.fillRect(0, 0, self.width, self.height)
        end

    end

    if (self._focus and self._active) then
        gfx.setImageDrawMode(gfx.kDrawModeFillWhite)
    end

    gfx.drawText(self._text, textPositionX, textPositionY);
    gfx.popContext();

    self:setImage(buttonImage)
    self:moveTo(self._buttonPositionX, self._buttonPositionY)
    self:add()

end
```

This function is used to give the button an image that will displayed to the screen as a sprite. This isn't really the 
interesting bit but I'll do a little to explain what is happening here.

First we create an image that is the width and height of the button we want to display, then we use a helper method to 
get the x and y co'ordinates of the text that will be displayed inside of the button.

gfx.pushContext tells the computer we now want to draw to this image. (This is similar to OpenGl or any low level graphics
library if you've used one previously). In the button I've added a few different states so if the button is not focused it
just displays text, if it has focus it's bordered, and if it has focus and is active it will be black with white text.

I first check to see if we have focus and if we do a draw a rectangle around the button, next I check if it is active and
draw a fill rectangle. You could use an if else here but I'm lazy and honestly I kind of think things look nicer when they
don't have else statements. Dealers choice.

Next we have the if (self._focus and self._active) statement. On this we change the drawer mode. This is a bit weird but
it's to set the colour of the text. Since the text is under the hood an image we need to use this function instead of just
changing the colour. Finally we draw the text and pop the context. (This tells the computer to stop drawing to the image)

Now we set the image of the sprite. setImage is an inbuilt function of the playdate SDK for the gfx.sprite. Our button 
class is extending this so we have access to all of it's methods and functions. It will tell the sprite to display the 
image we have created. Now we move it to the correct screen position and add it the drawer stack so it is drawn on the screen.


## Button events

Now we are going to define some different events on our button. These will change the state of the button and redraw it.

```lua
function Button:triggerActive(active)

    if (not self._focus) then
        self._active = false
        return;
    end

    self._active = active;
    self:displayButton()

    if (not self._active) then
        self:triggerClick()
    end
end

function Button:triggerFocus(focus)
    self._focus = focus
    self:displayButton()
end

function Button:triggerClick()
    self._emitter:emitEvent("buttonClick");
end
```

triggerActive tells changes the state of the button between pressed and not pressed. First we check if the button is in 
focus. I've decided that a button should only but active if it is focused. If it's not in focus we set the active state
to false and do an early return, meaning the button can never be active without being focused. Then we set the active 
state and redraw the button. Secondly we check to see if the button is false and if so trigger a click.

triggerFocus, here we simply change the focus to what is passed and redraw the button.

triggerClick, for this we simply emit an event telling whatever is listening that the button has been clicked. We could 
add some more triggers for if the button has focus, or loses focus but I didn't see the need for now.

Just in case, I'll include the remaining method which is calculateTextPosition, all this does is calculates the position
that the text should be drawn so it is centered within the rectangle

```lua
function Button:calculateTextPosition()

    local textPositionX = self.width / 2;
    textPositionX = textPositionX - (self._textWidth / 2)

    local textPositionY = self.height / 2
    textPositionY = textPositionY - (self._textHeight / 2)

    return textPositionX, textPositionY;
end
```

Now you may have realised our button doesn't know about inputs at all. It doesn't know that the buttons on the playdate 
exist so currently if we create a new button instance nothing would happen. Let's fix this. To do this we need to start 
modifying our main lua file again.

```lua
local button = Button(200, 140, 100, 50, "Start Game", controllerEmitter)

local buttonListener = Listener();
buttonListener.onEvent = function(listener, event)
   if (event.name == "downClick") then
      button:triggerFocus(true)
   end

   if (event.name == "upClick") then
      button:triggerFocus(false)
   end

   if (event.name == "aPress") then
      button:triggerActive(true)
   end

   if (event.name == "aRelease") then
      button:triggerActive(false);
   end

end

controllerEmitter:addListener(buttonListener)
```

First off we create our button passing it an x, y, width, height, text, and emitter. I've set this to the controllerEmitter
for now as it was there but we'd probably want a different one for this. Next we create our buttonListener and override 
it's onEvent handler. I then check if an event called downClick is triggered, and if it is triggerFocus, if the upButton
is clicked I trigger the focus to false, if a is pressed I set it to active and if a is released I set the active state
to false. Finally I add the buttonListener to the controllerEmitter.

This is all we need to do to start receiving inputs. Everything will now work.

![alt text](

Now, this might seem a lot of work but it's kind of cool as our button is now completely decoupled from all the inputs of
the PlayDate. For instance I wanted to get an image of all the states that the button could have and this was as simple as
this:

![alt text](
https://corofides.github.io/images/2024-03-23_button_2.png "All button states")

If I'd directly tied our button to our inputs this would have been a lot harder to achieve. It also means if we wanted to
create a menu for instance we can do that more easily and only the menu would need to care about the inputs, the buttons
and their states would be managed by the menu.

### Some thoughts.

Okay so doing this I had some thoughts. I should have guessed but functions are first class in lua so I'm considering just
binning the listener object and just using functions in the emitter. It's kind of useless anyway and is just there because
it looked nice.

Secondly, I've had this thought a few times but I kind of want to decouple the drawing stuff especially for the UI 
components. I really don't want to position things manually it sucks. I think with a bit of effort I could achieve something
similar to css/html and just have an object that can take a table and display something nicer. I don't really need anything
feature complete but just a few things would do. Border, padding, margin, width and height I think would cover most of my
needs. It just means I can get rid of the low level calls to draw and create nicer stuff doing it.

Also I just noticed I named this 2024-03-2024, oops. I've set it to the date of creation. I may give it a name later.

## Separate concerns of drawing.

Okay so I think we are going to try and do the html like thing today as it will solve a lot of future problems and seems
kind of fun. I'm just going to keep it simple and modal a block for now. We'll need the borders, padding, margin, and any
content that will be displayed in the block. I think this will either be text, image, or maybe another block.

Let's start with a simple class called View, can you tell I use React a bit, and it will take content, and a table called
params which we'll assign to the object

```lua
function View:init(content, params)

    self._defaultParams = {
        
    }

    self.params = params;
    self.content = content;

end
```

We'll also create a table as a const called default params. This will be used so we can set any uninitialised parameters
on the view. For now we'll just have some basic properties and we can extend this later:

```lua
self._defaultParams =  <const> = {
        borderTopWidth = 0,
        borderBottomWidth = 0,
        borderLeftWidth = 0,
        borderRightWidth = 0,
        paddingTop = 0,
        paddingLeft = 0,
        paddingBottom = 0,
        paddingRight = 0,
        marginTop = 0,
        marginLeft = 0,
        marginBottom = 0,
        marginRight = 0,
        top = 0,
        left = 0,
        color = gfx.kColorBlack,
    }
```

The border will specify the border width, margin will be used to offset from the current position, padding is internal 
padding or the distance from the border that the content will be, and for now color will just denote the color of the 
border and content, top and left define were the view should be drawn. I think this will do as we only really have two colours: black and white.

Next we'll add to helper methods to our class printParams and inflateParams. Print params will just loop through the 
params table and print the key and it's value and inflateParams will create a new table which contains all the default
parameters and overwrites any that have been declared in the parameters we've set.

```lua
function View:printParams()

    for key, value in pairs(self.params) do
        print(key, ":", value)
    end

end

function View:inflateParams(params)

    local inflatedParams = {};

    for key, value in pairs(self._defaultParams) do
        inflatedParams[key] = value;
    end

    for key, value in pairs(params) do
        inflatedParams[key] = value;
    end

    return inflatedParams

end
```

Let's give this a try and see what we get. (Note: I added in top and left later and can't be bothered to redo the 
screenshots so that's why they don't show)

```lua
local view = View("", {})
view:printParams()
```

![alt text](
https://corofides.github.io/images/inflated_params_default.png "List of default params")

And if we do the same thing but give it a border to begin with:

```lua
local view = View("", {borderTopWidth = 2, borderBottomWidth = 2, borderLeftWidth = 2, borderRightWidth = 2})
view:printParams()
```

![alt text](
https://corofides.github.io/images/inflated_params_custom.png "List of default params")

As you can see we now have a table of all our parameters but with the custom ones being custom and the default ones still
present even though we haven't passed them. So now we can be sure that these will always exist and be defined.

The next thing we need to do is be able to get the height and width of our sprite. I've created couple of helpers for this
to begin with we'll just assume that the content will always be text.

```lua
function View:getHeight()

    local height = 0

    height = height + self.params.borderTopWidth
    height = height + self.params.borderBottomWidth
    height = height + self.params.paddingTop
    height = height + self.params.paddingBottom

    --- Just assume content will be text for now.
    local font <const> = gfx.getFont()
    height = height + font:getHeight()

    return height
end

function View:getWidth()

    local width = 0

    width = width + self.params.borderLeftWidth
    width = width + self.params.borderRightWidth
    width = width + self.params.paddingLeft
    width = width + self.params.paddingRight

    --- Just assume content will be text for now.
    local font <const> = gfx.getFont()
    width = width + font:getTextWidth(self.content)

    return width
end
```

Okay, let's add our drawView method. For now we'll just display the content at the correct position and get the height 
and width of the image

```lua
function View:drawView()

    local width <const> = self:getWidth()
    local height <const> = self:getHeight()

    local viewImage = gfx.image.new(width, height);

    gfx.pushContext(viewImage)
    gfx.drawText(self.content, 0, 0)
    gfx.popContext()

    local topPosition = self.params.top + self.params.marginTop
    local leftPosition = self.params.left + self.params.marginLeft

    self:setImage(viewImage)
    self:moveTo(leftPosition, topPosition)
    self:add()

end
```

Now we can test it out by adding the following to our main.lua file

```lua
local view = View("This is a view", {
   left = 200,
   top = 140,
   borderTopWidth = 2,
   borderBottomWidth = 2,
   borderLeftWidth = 2,
   borderRightWidth = 2
})
view:drawView()
```

![alt text](
https://corofides.github.io/images/2024-03-24_11:45.png "A very basic view.")

As you can see we now have some text on the screen. This isn't very exciting but it makes for a good start.

To continue we want to start drawing our borders. In our button class we used a rectangle for this but this isn't going 
to work here as we need the borders to be independent of each other. To do this we'll be drawing each of the borders as 
four rectangles.

To do this, we need to modify our drawView method

```lua
function View:drawView()

    local width <const> = self:getWidth()
    local height <const> = self:getHeight()

    local viewImage = gfx.image.new(width, height);

    gfx.pushContext(viewImage)

    if (self.params.borderTopWidth > 0) then
        gfx.fillRect(0, 0, width, self.params.borderTopWidth)
    end

    if (self.params.borderBottomWidth > 0) then
        gfx.fillRect(0, height - self.params.borderBottomWidth, width, self.params.borderBottomWidth)
    end

    if (self.params.borderLeftWidth > 0) then
        gfx.fillRect(0, 0, self.params.borderLeftWidth, height)
    end

    if (self.params.borderRightWidth > 0) then
        gfx.fillRect(width - self.params.borderRightWidth, 0, width, height)
    end

    gfx.drawText(self.content, 0, 0)
    gfx.popContext()

    local topPosition = self.params.top + self.params.marginTop
    local leftPosition = self.params.left + self.params.marginLeft

    self:setImage(viewImage)
    self:moveTo(leftPosition, topPosition)
    self:add()

end

```

As you can wee we now check if each of the borders has a none zero value and if so we draw those borders in we can use the
width and height of the box with the appropriate width of the border to get our positions. Running this now results in 
the following.

![alt_text](https://corofides.github.io/images/2024-03-24_11:57.png "A view with borders.")

You may notice that our text is not positioned correctly this is because we used 0, 0 as the co'ordinates to draw the 
text at which means we aren't taking into account our border widths and padding. Let's fix this by modifying our draw 
method

![alt_text](
https://corofides.github.io/images/2024-03-24_12.02.44.png "Correctly positioned text, sort of.")

Now our text is correctly positioned. You may notice that it looks a little off still. This is because of line height. 
Essentially the font adds some extra spacing to account the things that go beyond the range of a normal letter. For 
instance a lower case 'y' has the little tail and this needs to be displayed. I'm not going to address this at present as
this is good enough for my purposes at the moment although a I may address this later.

Let's try adding a bit of padding.

```lua
local view = View("This is a view", {
   left = 200,
   top = 140,
   borderTopWidth = 2,
   borderBottomWidth = 2,
   borderLeftWidth = 2,
   borderRightWidth = 2,
   paddingLeft = 10,
   paddingRight = 10,
   paddingTop = 10,
   paddingBottom = 10,
})
view:drawView()
```

This is extremely useful. All I needed to do to change my view was change a few numbers in my parameters and the view was
redrawn. No messing about with context and low level drawing APIs. What we want to do next is be able to make views children
of views so this can become even more versatile.

To make this more useful we need to be able to display a few different things. Off the top of my head I think we'd need 
the following options

Nothing, text, an image, another view, and an array of views.

We can fairly easily modify our draw function to display nothing or another view.

```lua
--- let's just assume it's a view for now
    if (type(self.content) == "table") then
        self.content:drawView();
    end

    if (type(self.content) == "string") then
        gfx.drawText(self.content, contentPositionLeft, contentPositionTop)
    end
```

For the time being we'll assume that if a lua table is passed it is a view, we'll need to change this later as arrays 
are just indexed tables in Lua.

Let's try this in our main lua file

```lua
local view = View(null, {
   left = 200,
   top = 140,
   borderTopWidth = 2,
   borderBottomWidth = 2,
   borderLeftWidth = 2,
   borderRightWidth = 2,
   paddingLeft = 10,
   paddingRight = 10,
   paddingTop = 10,
   paddingBottom = 10,
})
view:drawView()
```

And to display our view within a view

```lua
local innerView = View("Test", {
   left = 200,
   top = 140,
   borderTopWidth = 2,
   borderBottomWidth = 2,
   borderLeftWidth = 2,
   borderRightWidth = 2,
   paddingLeft = 10,
   paddingRight = 10,
   paddingTop = 10,
   paddingBottom = 10,
   marginTop = -5,
   marginLeft = -5,
})

local view = View(innerView, {
   left = 200,
   top = 140,
   borderTopWidth = 2,
   borderBottomWidth = 2,
   borderLeftWidth = 2,
   borderRightWidth = 2,
   paddingLeft = 10,
   paddingRight = 10,
   paddingTop = 10,
   paddingBottom = 10,
})
view:drawView()
```

As you can see we now have a view containing another view. This will be super useful at later stages especially once we 
introduce absolute and relative positioning to our views.

To add in the ability to display multiple views with our view first of all we are going to need a helper method. We need
to check if the table we are passing in is an array to do this we can loop through our table and check to see if all the
keys in the table are an integer or not a string. We'll call this is_array and just place it in our main lua file as it 
may be helpful for some other things.

```lua
function is_array(table)

   local is_array = true;

   for key, value in pairs(table) do
      if type(key) == "string" then
         is_array = false
         break
      end
   end

   return is_array

end
```

This may get a bit in the weeds for a while as we need to do a few different things now and since I'm writing this as I 
go today I'm not exactly sure how to structure this segment. So first off we need to check is anywhere we have a table as
content in our view if it's an array or view. If it's a view we'll display it otherwise we'll just add a 'do something' 
comment.

The three methods that currently need this are getWidth, getHeight, and drawView methods

```lua
function View:getHeight()

    local height = 0

    height = height + self.params.borderTopWidth
    height = height + self.params.borderBottomWidth
    height = height + self.params.paddingTop
    height = height + self.params.paddingBottom

    if (type(self.content) == "table") then

        if (is_array(self.content)) then
            -- Do something
        else
            height = height + self.content:getHeight();
        end
    end

    if (type(self.content) == "string") then
        local font <const> = gfx.getFont()
        height = height + font:getHeight()
    end

    return height
end

function View:getWidth()

    local width = 0

    width = width + self.params.borderLeftWidth
    width = width + self.params.borderRightWidth
    width = width + self.params.paddingLeft
    width = width + self.params.paddingRight

    -- Assume view for now
    if (type(self.content) == "table") then

        if (is_array(self.content)) then
            -- Do stuff
        else
            width = width + self.content:getWidth();
        end

    end

    if (type(self.content) == "string") then
        local font <const> = gfx.getFont()
        width = width + font:getTextWidth(self.content)
    end

    return width
end

function View:drawView()

    local width <const> = self:getWidth()
    local height <const> = self:getHeight()

    local contentPositionLeft = self.params.borderLeftWidth + self.params.paddingLeft;
    local contentPositionTop = self.params.borderTopWidth + self.params.paddingTop;

    local viewImage = gfx.image.new(width, height);

    gfx.pushContext(viewImage)

    if (self.params.borderTopWidth > 0) then
        gfx.fillRect(0, 0, width, self.params.borderTopWidth)
    end

    if (self.params.borderBottomWidth > 0) then
        gfx.fillRect(0, height - self.params.borderBottomWidth, width, self.params.borderBottomWidth)
    end

    if (self.params.borderLeftWidth > 0) then
        gfx.fillRect(0, 0, self.params.borderLeftWidth, height)
    end

    if (self.params.borderRightWidth > 0) then
        gfx.fillRect(width - self.params.borderRightWidth, 0, width, height)
    end

    --- print(type(self.content))

    --- let's just assume it's a view for now
    if (type(self.content) == "table") then

        if (is_array(self.content)) then
            print("Is Array")
        else
            self.content:drawView();
        end

    end

    if (type(self.content) == "string") then
        gfx.drawText(self.content, contentPositionLeft, contentPositionTop)
    end

    gfx.popContext()

    local topPosition = self.params.top + self.params.marginTop
    local leftPosition = self.params.left + self.params.marginLeft

    self:setImage(viewImage)
    self:moveTo(leftPosition, topPosition)
    self:add()

end
```

Sorry, about the code dump but we've just added an if else statement to anywhere were we reference the content and it's
a table.

Let's talk about our getWidth and getHeight method. For now these have been working fine but we kind of need to make a 
distinction now. See we technically have two options here, inner and outer. In css inner would be padding, and content. 
Outer would be margin, border, padding, and content. When I'm doing dev work in CSS / HTML I generally always use 
border-box which changes this slightly. Inner is now border, padding, and content and outer just adds in the margin.

Since I'm coding this and I can't think of a decent reason not to I'm just going to do this as if border box is always on
however you could easily modify this to work the other way.

To begin with let's change the names of our getWidth and getHeight methods. Since these exclude the margins we'll name 
these getInnerHeight and getInnerWidth

Next we'll create two new methods getOuterHeight and getOuterWidth all these will do is add on the margin to the inner
width and height.

```lua
function View:getOuterHeight()
    
    local height = self:getInnerHeight();
    
    height = height + self.params.marginTop;
    height = height + self.params.marginBottom;
    
    return height;
    
end

function View:getOuterWidth()
    
    local width = self:getInnerWidth()
    
    width = width + self.params.marginLeft
    width = width + self.params.marginRight
    
    return width;
    
end
```

Now we need to get the correct width and height for our view when it is passed an array of views.
