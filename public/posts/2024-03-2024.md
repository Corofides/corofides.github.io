# Something In, Something Out

Okay, so I have no idea why I am writing this or if it will continue but whatever.

I was kind of bored so I'd went to lay down in bed just sort of laying in the dark thinking about things. Like usual I
ended up thinking about stuff I could potentially do to make some money and that led me to think about games. Now, I'm
not really great at making stuff or following through on things and I've been watching a Pokemon Let's Play so I was
going down that kind of angle. RPG, Open Map, Menu combat system. Then I started thinking what if you simplify it even
more as a thought exercise. This led me to like Event based systems and the 'what is a game'? Question which leads to the
A happens -> B follows. Input -> Output, Something In -> Something Out.

Anyway, brain goes fucking nuts now thinking about event driven stuff and I thought it might be a fun little exercise
so... let's see what happens.
