# PlayJam 4

https://itch.io/jam/playjam-4

As mentioned yesterday I'm going to be taking part in the PlayJam 4 and try and create a game for the Playdate in Lua. 
I'm going to be posting updates to this page as I progress so I'm setting it up in advance.

Not long to go. I'm probably not going to do much tonight as it's rather late for me these days but I do want to at least
see what the theme is and maybe start coding something. We'll see. I've held off on creating a repo. I've been playing
around in Lua and the SDK and am now feeling massively under prepared...

In the true spirit of these things I am totally confused as the theme seems not to be were I expected it to be. The 
repository is up though... guess I'll just start playing around with some angles until I can work out what the theme 
actually is.
