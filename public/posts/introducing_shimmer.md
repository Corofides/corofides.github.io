## Introducing Shimmer

I've started a new personal project. Shimmer. This is going to be a Content Management System for GitHub pages. It's 
currently what is powering this website and hopefully a few more side projects I've got going at the same time. The idea
being is that it will render content from various JSON and Readme files to offer a fairly quick and easy way to build up
a website that can then be displayed using GitHub pages or any hosting provider really. It's using ReactJS for the frontend
and a bunch of static assets for the content.

### Why am I making this?

As I mentioned I've got a few ideas for some personal projects I want to make and this seemed like a decent way of jumping
into that. I've also wanted a decent project to start playing around in React a bit more. I've been using the framework on
a few projects but feel like I lack some knowledge in it. I'm hoping this gives me a decent project to start exploring the
framework a bit more. Another thing is I've been ignoring GitHub for a while and they've added a bunch of cool new features
I'd like to use this as a way of exploring those in depth.

### What's the process for building it?

Currently I've got a fairly simple skeleton lined out. There's a grid that's displayed and you can populate that with widgets
using JSON. This will allow you to rapidly build up the pages and add new content and features.

As I use this on projects I'm hoping I can add new widgets and features to the CMS as I discover them. For instance typing
this I've realised I currently have no way of pushing a post in draft mode so that is something I can add to the Shimmer
project and in future it will be available for all my future sites based on this.

### Long term goals.

I've got a couple of long term goals for this. That probably won't happen anytime soon

- Editor
- Android App
- iOS App

For now that's about it. You can check out the project on GitHub or the site which is currently just a testing bed for widgets
but I'm hoping to make something for it soon.
